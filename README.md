# cursedutils
do unholy things to python in order to aid developers to do unholy things to python.
Open to pull requests, ideally this would become a community effort.

# API
This module uses an advanced field of python called "Esoteric Python" in order to optimise the terribleness of the code.

# cursed.py
Miscellaneous code is kept here, if it cannot be categorised into the following:

# death.py
McNuke class is for recreational purposes only. 
*BEWARE OF THE DEATH MODULE. IF YOU RUN ANY OF ITS CODE, THERE WILL BE MUCH WEEPING AND GNASHING OF TEETH.*

# iostreams
c++ is now valid python syntax.
also, bugger calling the exit function.
NOTE: this module may cause difficulties when printing globals(). dict may need to be hacked to prevent exit from executing when globals() is printed.

# wrappers
decorate your functions and classes using the @ symbol followed by any callable expression.
classes can become object instantiation statements!

# pep ripoffs
code designed to chuck off at Python Enhancement Proposals or substitute them with minimalist code.

# natural number syntax
the original idea behind the module, kept for legacy, despite its many bugs.

# XD License 6.9
